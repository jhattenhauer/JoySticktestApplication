This project is an application for testing a gamepad (designed and assembled by James Hattenhauer for GRi Simulations) for use in simulation testing software.
It is also my first GitHub Project and has been a great time learning so far, I feel like a real programmer, anyway...

Uses Wpf and C#, as well as the DirectX.Xinput wrapper for inputs

As Xinput is only for xbox devices the use of a interpretor for directinput devices is required for generic controllers.
I recommend: XOutput <https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput>
Hopefully only temporary, I would like to get full HID controller support eventually.

Very Cool, and if you are trying to read the code; good luck...
