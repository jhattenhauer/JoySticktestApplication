This project is an application for testing a gamepad (designed and assembled by James Hattenhauer for GRi Simulations) for use in simulation testing software.
It is also my first GitHub Project and has been a great time learning so far, I feel like a real programmer, anyway...

Uses Wpf and C#, as well as the DirectX.DirectInput wrapper for inputs
Currently Working with the Leo Bodnar BU0836X and a Apem HF50S10 joystick.

Very Cool, and if you are trying to read the code; good luck...
